## Calculates and saves tissue temperature during a hyperthermia treatment

<p> This is a code from a research that I am carrying out at the Federal University of Juiz de Fora, in which the behavior of temperature in healthy and cancerous tissues is studied after 50 minutes of the injection of nanoparticles in the center of a tumor. As many of the parameters are obtained experimentally, they carry with them an uncertainty. The idea of the research is to study the influence of uncertainty on these parameters when performing hyperthermia treatment. </p>
<p>In the future, parallelized codes will be implemented, in which the complexity increases a little and the study becomes more faithful to reality.</P>
