## Calculates and saves tissue temperature during a hyperthermia treatment

<p> This is a code from a research that I am carrying out at the Federal University of Juiz de Fora, in which the objective is to simulate the treatment of tumors through hyperthermia by magnetic nanoparticles, considering Pennesâ€™ bioheat transfer equation. The behavior of temperature, in healthy and cancerous tissues, is studied after 50 minutes of the injection of nanoparticles in the center of the tumor. As many of the parameters are obtained experimentally, they carry with them an uncertainty. The idea of the research is to study the influence of uncertainty on these parameters when performing hyperthermia treatment. </p>
<p>In order to obtain better results, the number of experiments should be quite large (5000 - 10000). Thus, the time spent to execute the code starts to increase more and more. To handle this situation, the idea is to parallelize the code so that several steps can be executed at the same time. This will be done in further studies.</p>
